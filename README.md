# Coding Challenge

Hey!

Here's your coding challenge - we want you to build a todo app in python and flask with a sqlite back end. 

The todo app must:

- Show a list of todos,
- Be able to add a todo,
- Be able to set a due date for a todo,
- Be able to mark a todo as completed,
- Be able to edit a todo.

Important things we want to see are:

- **Show your working:** We want to see how you go about working. Fork this repository, write the code on your fork, and submit pull requests for each major step that you complete. Use your own judgement as to how often to update, as long as you show your working. [This should get you started with git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [this for forking and pull requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

- **Use this tech, it's chosen on purpose:** Build the web app using Python 3.4 and the Flask framework.  [This should get you started with flask](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework), and [here are the docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).

- **Show some flair:** If you can, save your data in a file based (not in-memory) sqlite database in the root of your project. [This should get you started with sqlite in flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/sqlite3/). While look and feel is not essential, we are primarily interested in your code, but consider using a style library to make it look good.


If you have any questions, please open an issue on this repository and we'll get back to you.

Good luck! üçÄ
